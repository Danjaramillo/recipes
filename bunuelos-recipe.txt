Ingredients

4 eggs
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup vegetable oil for frying

Directions
In a large bowl combine eggs with 1/4 cup sugar and beat until thick and 
lemon-colored. 
Add the oil. 
Combine separately 1-1/2 cups of the flour, the baking powder and the salt. 
Gradually add this to the egg mixture and beat well.
Turn dough out onto a floured board (use remaining 1/2 cup flour) and knead 
thoroughly until dough is smooth.
Shape dough into sixteen balls. 
Roll each one into a circle about 5 inches in diameter. 
Let stand uncovered on waxed paper for about 10 minutes.
Heat oil in a deep fry pan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
Fry circles until golden brown, turning once. 
Drain on paper towels. 
Sprinkle with sugar/cinnamon mixture. Store airtight.

We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention 
value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount may vary depending on cook time 
and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used.
